Kabila I-PER

the O

told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan I-MISC

have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O
multinational O
force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O
might O
help O
the O
Zairean I-MISC

regain O
control O
of O
the O

Kinshasa I-LOC
opposes O
airdrops O

apparently O
because O
the O

of O

their O

Canadian I-MISC

on O

that O
the O

probably O
not O

intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O

" O
It O

n't O
look O
as O
though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O
in O
any O

" O
Young I-PER
told O

. O

But O
General O
Baril I-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O
the O

stabilises O

we O

have O
access O

" O
If O
they O

they O
are O
too O
weak O
, O
then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O
using O
air O
delivery O

( O

...It O

it O

the O

it O

Hakme I-PER

not O

to O
